# I created a simple calculator using HTML and CSS from scratch. I designed the layout and styled the buttons to make the calculator visually appealing. I also used a color scheme inspired by the Effective Dev Insta Page to give the calculator a modern look. The calculator can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and displays the result in real-time as the user enters numbers and clicks the operator buttons. I hope you enjoy using my calculator as much as I enjoyed creating it!
